<section className='main-section'>

#### Step Api

##### selector

Selector of the element that you want to highlight. To see how to get any element of selector in any website please read [here](https://support.helpdocs.io/article/eh3pzxNwYf-grabbing-css-selectors-from-your-browser#:~:text=Simply%20right%20click%20and%20click,CSS%20selectors%20for%20that%20element.)

##### target

`target` is an alternative of `selector` property. You could give the `target` element directly without specifying its selector.

```javascript
const targetEl = document.getElementById('#my-great-element');
const tour = new Tour({
  steps: [
    {
      target: targetEl,
      // other properties will be here
    },
  ],
});
```

!Note that if you provide `selector` and `target` both in a step. `selector`
will be used for getting the element by Tour.js.

##### title

Title of the step element

##### content

Body of your step element. It could be just text or any HTML content that you provide.

```javascript
This is a valid content text.

<p>
	This is also valid <strong>context</strong>.
</p>

<div>
	<h2>
		This is even valid <i>context</I>
	<h2/>
	<p>
		This is an extra element.
	</p>
</div>
```

##### next

To change text of `next` button.

##### prev

To change text of `prev` button.

##### finish

To change text of `finish` button.

!Tour.js creates your access buttons under the hood according to steps count but if you wish to remove a button in a certain step please pass `false` to it.

```javascript
const tour = new Tour({
  steps: [
    {
      next: false, // `next` button will not be disappear in this individual step.
      // rest of your properties
    },
  ],
});
```
