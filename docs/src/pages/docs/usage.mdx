<section className='main-section'>
#### Usage

Tour.js consists of js and CSS files. The CSS file must be linked/imported throughout your app.
If you use any bundler for your app you can use it directly by importing in your js file.

```javascript
import Tour from 'tour.js';
```

First crate a new `Tour` instance for your tours with steps.

```javascript
const tour = new Tour({
	/// Tour options will be here
	steps: [
		{
			selector: #my-great-title
			title: 'Learn how to use tour.js'
			content: 'Here this is the great explanation'
		},
		// add more steps here
	]
});
```

Then fire it whenever you wish

```javascript
tour.start();
```

Alternatively you could manipulate the steps any time even that you can create instance without explicitly giving the steps while initializing.

```javascript
tour.changeSteps([
  /// steps array will be here
]);
```

</section>

export default ({ children }) => (
  <DocumentationLayout>{children}</DocumentationLayout>
);
